      # reasons, including:
      #   - better performance.
      #   - reduce issues where Radarr database connections are blocked.
      #   - 'sqlite' is generally not supported on NFS.
      #     - see: https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q5

      # instead the goal is to use 'rsync' to synchronize the contents of this
      # volume to the NAS, where it can be then subsequently backed up.
